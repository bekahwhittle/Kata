// You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can
// "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that
// should be displayed next to such an item.
//
// Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input
// array, containing the names of people who like an item. It must return the
// display text as shown in the examples:

// likes [] // must be "no one likes this"
// likes ["Peter"] // must be "Peter likes this"
// likes ["Jacob", "Alex"] // must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
// likes ["Max", "John", "Mark"] // must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
// likes ["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"] // must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others
// like this"
console.log("hi");

var friends = ["John", "Patrick", "Bekah", "Jamal"];
if (friends => 1) {
  console.log(friends + " liked this");
}
// while (friends.length => 1) {
//   console.log("liked this");
// }
